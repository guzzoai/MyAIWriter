# Fixed Bugs

✅ Total Words And Avg Words counts is wrong on the dashboard. i created two articles of 1200 and 1000 word wount. It says 012001000 Total Words and 6000500 Avg. Words/Post
- Fixed by converting word counts to numbers before summing and using toLocaleString() for formatting

✅ clicking on the edit button in the dashboard doesn't direct to the edit screen but preview screen.
- Fixed by creating a dedicated 'edit' view mode in App.tsx and updating the Dashboard component to properly navigate to it

✅ the edit screen is to small, only 3 row are visible
- Fixed by increasing the textarea height to min-h-[500px] and making it resizable vertically

✅ the view screen doesn't show html formatted text but the raw md text.
- Fixed by ensuring HtmlPreview is used for formatted view and MarkdownPreview for markdown view

✅ Raw html button shows raw md text
- Fixed by improving the view mode cycling logic in BlogPreview component

✅ The html preview uses the MarkDown code to preview and not html formated with <h1> tags
- Fixed by implementing a markdownToHtml conversion function and using it to properly format content in HtmlPreview and PrintView components

✅ When in view mode and you click Formatted button, Copy Html and Raw HTML button are using the Mark Down formatting and not html
- Fixed by updating the handleCopy function to use the appropriate content format based on the view mode

✅ clicking on the title in the dashboard should open the view window of the post
- Fixed by making post titles clickable in the Dashboard component with visual indicators
