## üß† Prompt: Build an Affiliate Blog Generator App (MyWriter)

```text
Build a modern web app called **MyWriter** that helps users generate high-quality, SEO-optimized blog posts for affiliate marketing using the Gemini Pro 2.5 model via the OpenRouter API.

---

### üß© App Functionality:

The app should include:
1. A **form interface** where users input the following fields:
   - Blog Post Topic (text)
   - Target Keyword (text)
   - Word Count (number)
   - Additional Context (textarea)
   - Article Type (dropdown: Informational, Listicle, How-To Guide, Anecdote, Story)
   - Tone (dropdown: Professional, Conversational, Friendly, Authoritative, Casual)
   - Intended Audience (text)
   - Toggles (boolean switches) for:
     - First Person (use ‚ÄúI‚Äù)
     - Include Stories & Examples
     - Add a Hook
     - Add Interactive HTML Element

2. A **‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù button** that triggers an API call to Gemini Pro 2.5 using OpenRouter (API key provided).

3. Use the dynamic form data to construct a blog generation prompt (as specified below) and send it to the Gemini API.

4. On successful response, **display the blog post in a dashboard preview**, where the user can:
   - View the generated blog post
   - Edit the content inline
   - Delete or regenerate posts

---

### üîå API Integration:

- Use `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
- Model: `google/gemini-pro`
- Use Bearer token from stored user API key
- POST request should send the blog prompt in the `messages` array as a system/user message

### üí° Prompt Logic (passed to Gemini):

Use this template to construct the system prompt dynamically:
